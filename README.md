# scheduling_algorithms
Implementation of a few CPU scheduling algorithms.
I tried to actually execute processes using a clock instead of just calculating average timings.
Output includes a Gantt Chart, a Process life cycle info Table and average waiting and turnaround timings.
So, if you want to understand the base code, try FCFS or SJF.
