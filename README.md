# scheduling_algorithms
Implementation of a few CPU scheduling algorithms.
I tried to actually execute processes using a clock instead of just calculating average timinings.
Output includes a Gantt Chart, a detail Process life cycle info Table and average waiting and turaround timings.
Firstly, i wrote the Base Code and then made changes accordingly.
So, if you want to understand the base code, try FCFS or SJF.
